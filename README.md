## THE WAREZONE

Welcome! This is where I will store all things related to coding for my computer science classes. I primarily use Scratch and Python with my high school students. So let's begin.

### Scratch

Scratch is the worldâ€™s largest coding community for children and a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital stories, games, and animations. Scratch is designed, developed, and moderated by the Scratch Foundation, a nonprofit organization.

Scratch promotes computational thinking and problem solving skills; creative teaching and learning; self-expression and collaboration; and equity in computing.

Scratch is always free and is available in more than 70 languages.
