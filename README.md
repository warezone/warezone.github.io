Welcome! This is where I will store all things related to coding for my computer science classes. I primarily use Scratch and Python with my high school students. So let's begin.

### Scratch

Scratch is the worldâ€™s largest coding community for children and a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital stories, games, and animations. Scratch is designed, developed, and moderated by the Scratch Foundation, a nonprofit organization.

Scratch promotes computational thinking and problem solving skills; creative teaching and learning; self-expression and collaboration; and equity in computing. Scratch is available in more than 70 languages. Use the following resources to get started with Scratch. <br>

- Explore Scratch [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/all) Tutorials to find out how you can create stories, animations, games, and more!
- Download and print [Coding Cards](https://resources.scratch.mit.edu/www/cards/en/scratch-cards-all.pdf) for step-by-step instructions for a variety of projects.

### Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.

Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[33] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.
